# A not-really-functional serverless http proxy prototype

I wanted to make a HTTP proxy (the kind which you don't need to change proxy settings for) that mostly worked and could run on something like Deno Deploy. It turned out to be a bit more involved than I thought, so I'm leaving this archived here for now (maybe I'll come back to it later, or maybe someone else will find it useful).

`main.ts` and `old.ts` contain 2 different attempts, with `old.ts` being completely useless, and `main.ts` having an actual start

(ignore `slopefield.html` that was for math homework and it ended up here somehow)
